<div class="hd5">I.1 The `be' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that a person or thing is something. They are all <span class="bold">link verbs</span> (<r>see Chapter 5</r>). We include here verbs such as <span class="italics">comprise 2</span> and <span class="italics">make up</span>, where the Subject indicates the parts, members, or elements of something, and <span class="italics">comprise 1</span>, where the Complement indicates the parts of something.</p>

  <li><span class="example">The Chinese character for wise leader <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is made up</span> of three symbols</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>Note that because <span class="italics">comprise 1</span> and <span class="italics">comprise 2</span> represent the relationship between a whole and its parts in opposite ways, the active of <span class="italics">comprise 1</span> and the passive of <span class="italics">comprise 2</span> have the same meaning.</n>

<div class="hd5">I.5 The `depart' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with living, dying, or leaving somewhere. The Complement describes the condition or situation of the Subject during his or her life or at the time of dying or leaving.  This is a productive use. The verbs listed here are the ones which are most frequently used in this way.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Lloyd <span class="bold"><span class="underline">departed</span> a shaken man</span>.</span></li>

<p>Most phrasal verbs have the patterns <span class="pattern">V n P</span> and <span class="pattern">V P n (not pron)</span>. That is, the noun group comes either between the verb and the particle or after the particle. If the noun group comes after the particle, it cannot be a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">filled</span> it <span class="bold">up</span></span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">filled up</span> the barrel</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">He filled up it</span>.</p>

<p>However, some phrasal verbs have the pattern <span class="pattern">V P n</span> only. That is, the noun group comes after the particle and it is sometimes a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">went without</span> his lunch</span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">went without</span> it</span></slx>.</p>

<span class="pg">18</span> The two kinds of phrasal verbs are shown separately in the lists below.

<p>Verbs with this structure cover a very wide range of meanings. There are also many types of relationship between the verb and the noun group. The meaning groups in this section are grouped into larger groups, each showing one kind of relationship between the verb and the noun group:</p>

<p>II.1 The `kill', `eat', and `fix' groups: concrete actions which change or affect the thing indicated by the noun group. <br/><span class="italics">The soldiers <span class="underline">destroyed</span> the building.</span> <br/>II.2 The `bring', `buy', and `operate' groups: concrete or abstract actions which involve moving something, physically or metaphorically. <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="underline">sold</span> his books.</span> <br/>II.3 The `cover', `follow', and `record' groups: concrete actions which do not change, move, or affect the thing indicated by the noun group. <br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">recorded</span> the bird's song.</span> <br/>II.4 The `build' group: concrete actions which create the thing indicated by the noun group. <br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">built</span> a large tower.</span> <br/>II.5 The `change', `concern', and `arrange' groups: abstract actions which change or affect the thing indicated by the noun group. <br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">increased</span> the price.</span> <br/>II.6 The `watch', `break a record', and `approve' groups: abstract actions which do not affect the thing indicated by the noun group. <br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">watched</span> her favourite television programme.</span> <br/>II.7 The `form' group: abstract actions which create the thing indicated by the noun group. <br/><span class="italics">She <span class="underline">established</span> a hostel for battered wives.</span> <br/>II.8 The `start' and `stop' group: starting, finishing, or doing an action in a particular way. <span class="italics">They <span class="underline">abandoned</span> the climb.</span> <br/>II.9 The `do' and `take', `turn a corner', and `open your eyes' groups: concrete and abstract actions expressed by the verb and the noun group together. <br/><span class="italics">I <span class="underline">had a bath</span>.</span> <br/>II.10 The `face', `take three days', and `see' groups: relations of place and time expressed by the verb and the noun group together. <br/><span class="italics">The meeting <span class="underline">lasted</span> an hour.</span> <br/>II.11 The `top', `develop', and `include' groups: qualities or roles of the Subject expressed by the verb and the noun group together. <br/><span class="italics">The child <span class="underline">developed</span> several bad habits.</span> <br/>II.12 The `show', `allow', and `identify' groups: logical relations between the Subject and the Object. <br/><span class="italics">The experiments <span class="underline">confirm</span> our theory.</span> <br/>II.13 The `hear', `interest', and `give an impression' groups: thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. <br/><span class="italics">They <span class="underline">heard</span> a loud cry.</span> <br/>II.14 The `say', `describe', and `call' groups: acts of communication. <br/><span class="italics">I <span class="underline">asked</span> three questions.</span></p>

<span class="pattern">V n</span> is by far the most frequent verb pattern in English. The lists below contain only verbs which are among the 400 most frequently occurring verbs in the Bank of English. A typical Object is indicated in brackets where this is helpful.

<p>Not all the verbs with this structure are used in the passive. Verbs which never or rarely occur in the passive are indicated with * in the lists below.</p>

<span class="pg">19</span> <div class="hd5">II.1 The `kill', `eat', and `fix' groups</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with a concrete action or event which changes or affects the person or thing indicated by the Object. They can be divided into eight groups:</p>

<p>(i) The `kill' group <br/>(ii) The `touch' group <br/>(iii) The `eat' group <br/>(iv) The `prepare' group <br/>(v) The `fix' group <br/>(vi) The `change' group <br/>(vii) The `feed' group <br/>(viii) The `protect' group</p>

<div class="hd8">(i) The `kill' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with harming, breaking, attacking, or destroying something or someone. We include here <span class="italics">abandon</span>, which indicates that someone is harmed by being left by someone.</p>

<n>The phrasal verbs <span class="italics">carry on, finish up, leave off</span> and <span class="italics">strike up</span> have the pattern <span class="pattern">V P n (not pron)</span> only.</n>

<div class="hd5">II.9 The `do' and `take', `turn a corner', and `open your eyes' groups</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with both concrete and abstract actions and events. The verbs and the Objects do not indicate separate entities; the verb and the Object together express the action or event. They can be divided into three groups:</p>

<p>(i) The `do' and `take' group <br/>(ii) The `turn a corner' group <br/>(iii) The `open your eyes' group</p>

<div class="hd8">(i) The `do' and `take' group</div>

<p>These verbs and Objects are not separable and it is not possible to replace the Objects by pronouns. For example, it does not make sense to say `they wanted a verdict so we <span class="pg">42</span>  returned it', or `he offered me a sip and I took it'. This means that the clause does not focus attention on what is done to the Object but on what the Subject does, or on something that happens to the Subject.  The verb and the Object together describe an action by the Subject.</p>

<p>These verbs, or verbs and Objects together, are concerned with processes that take place in the mind, such as thinking, perceiving, or feeling. They can be divided into four groups:</p>

<p>(i) The `hear' group <br/>(ii) The `interest' group <br/>(iii) The `give an impression' group <br/>(iv) The `eyes follow' group</p>

<div class="hd8">(i) The `hear' group</div>

<p>a) The noun group is the Object.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed</span>. Verbs which never or rarely occur in the passive are shown by * in the lists above. Some verbs, when used in the passive, always have the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed <span class="italics">by</span> n</span> (<r>see page xxx</r>). The passive of some verbs is usually or often formed with <span class="italics">get</span> instead of <span class="italics">be</span> (<r>see page xxx</r>).</p>

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle or after the particle. Most phrasal verbs have both these patterns, and if the Object comes after the particle, it is not a personal pronoun. You say  <br/><span class="italics">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">looked</span> them <span class="bold">up</span></span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">looked up</span> some old friends</span></slx>  <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">I looked up them</span>.  <br/>This first type of phrasal verb is included in the lists with the heading <span class="pattern">V n P</span> and <span class="pattern">V P n (not pron)</span>. However, with some phrasal verbs, the Object comes after the particle only and it may be a personal pronoun. You say  <br/><span class="italics">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">ran into</span> some old friends</span></span>  <br/>or <span class="italics">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">ran into</span> them</span>.</slx>  <br/>This second type of phrasal verb is shown under the heading <span class="pattern">V P n</span> or, if the verb has two particles, <span class="pattern">V P P n</span>.</p>

<p>Verbs with this structure are all concerned with doing something. The Adjunct indicates how the action is done.  In most cases, the Adjunct contains the noun <span class="italics">way</span>. This pattern is productive: many verbs occur in the pattern <span class="pattern">V n</span> if the noun group contains the word <span class="italics">way</span>. The verbs listed here are the ones which are most frequently used in this way.</p>

<div class="hd3"><span class="italics">get</span> V-ed</div>

<p>The passive voice is sometimes formed with <span class="italics">get</span> instead of <span class="italics">be</span>. Most of the verbs with the passive pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">get</span> V-ed</span> also have the passive <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed</span>. The list below shows the verbs most frequently used with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">get</span> V-ed</span> and the phrasal verbs most frequently used with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">get</span> V-ed P</span>.</p>

<p>Many of the verbs that often have a passive with <span class="italics">get</span> indicate that something unpleasant is happening, such as <span class="italics">attack, criticize, hit, injure, penalize, rape</span>, and <span class="italics">wound</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Eric seems to be the one paying for his incredible talent because defenders are getting away with it while he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">gets penalised</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">And sometimes, of course, innocent bystanders <span class="bold"><span class="underline">get wounded</span></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>Other verbs have a passive with <span class="italics">get</span> to emphasize that someone else, not the person indicated by the Subject, does the action and is responsible for it, even if the person indicated by the Subject wishes the action to be done.</n>




<ul class="example">

<div class="list"> come between pair up (usu passive) </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verb with Object</div>

<p>a) The plural noun group is the Object.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed</span>.</p>

<p>c) Phrasal verb patterns are the same except that there is also a particle, P. The Object comes either between the verb and the particle or after the particle. Most phrasal verbs have both these patterns, and if the Object comes after the particle, it is not a personal pronoun. You say <br/><span class="italics">I nearly <span class="bold"><span class="underline">mixed</span> them <span class="bold">up</span></span></span> <br/>or <span class="italics">I nearly <span class="bold"><span class="underline">mixed up</span> the two twins</span></slx> <br/>but you do not say <span class="italics">I nearly mixed up them.</span> <br/>However, in the case of one phrasal verb, <span class="italics">come between</span>, the Object comes after the particle only and it may be a personal pronoun.</p>

<p>d) Many of the verbs which have this pattern are <span class="bold">ergative reciprocal verbs</span> (<r>see Chapter 8</r>).</p>

<p>Some verbs with this pattern are generally considered to be <span class="bold">link verbs</span> because they need an adjective after them to complete their meaning (<r>see Chapter 5</r>).

</ul>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb and the `-ing' form are two verbs <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">start laughing</span>, the <span class="italics">starting</span> and the <span class="italics">laughing</span> are not two processes but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure tables above this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive, but the `-ing' form may be passive, consisting of <span class="italics">being</span> and an `-ed' form.  <br/><span class="italics">To <span class="bold"><span class="underline">avoid</span> being caught</span>, the gang sometimes cut off the phone.</span></p>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The first verb and the to-infinitive are two verbs <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>.  This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">begin to see</span> something, the <span class="italics">beginning</span> and the <span class="italics">seeing</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure tables above this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<span class="pg">91</span> b) This structure has no passive, but the to-infinitive may be passive, consisting of <span class="italics">to be</span> and an `-ed' form. <br/><span class="italics">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">refused</span> to be admitted</span> to the hospital</span>.

Indeed, you may promise to pay but then not pay.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive, but the to-infinitive clause may itself be passive, beginning with <span class="italics">to be</span> and a past participle.  <br/><span class="italics">Everyone leaving the library <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can</span></span> now <span class="bold"><span class="bold">expect</span> to be searched</span>.</span></p>

</table>

<div class="hd5">1 The `come' and `go' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate that the action indicated by the second verb is done. Only the base forms of the verbs, <span class="italics">come</span> and <span class="italics">go</span>, are used in this pattern, and only in American English.</p>

</ul>
<span class="pg">97</span>
<span class="list" cols="3"> <c sn="1,2">help</c> </span>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The first verb and the infinitive are two verbs <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>.  This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">come see</span> someone, the <span class="italics">coming</span> and the <span class="italics">seeing</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure table above this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

</ul>
<div class="list"> arrange dictate ensure fix guarantee mean mind ordain provide see </div>

<div class="hd5">9 The `go' group</div>

<p>These verbs are used when you are quoting something. We include here <span class="italics">say 6</span>, which you use when indicating the information given by something such as a clock or a map. These verbs have an inanimate Subject.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The story <span class="bold"><span class="underline">goes</span> that the dish was invented by Kaiser Franz-Joseph's cook, who had promised to make his master something delicious to tempt his jaded appetite</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The map <span class="bold"><span class="underline">says</span> there's six of them</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> go say </div>

<div class="hd5">10 Verbs with other meanings</div>

<p>There are a number of other verbs which have this pattern.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Like Clinton, he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">is gambling</span> that a recovering economy will swell the government's coffers</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The notion of self-sacrifice is a nonsense. It <span class="bold"><span class="underline">presupposes</span> that we can give to others something which we do not have ourselves</span>.</span></li>

  <li><span class="example">Federal law <span class="bold"><span class="underline">requires</span> that consumers be informed whenever an investigative report is ordered</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">get out</span> and <span class="italics">remain</span>, the that-clause is really part of the pattern of the noun that comes before the verb.</n>

<span class="pg">102</span> <span class="example">When word <span class="bold"><span class="underline">got out</span> that we had spent nearly \$1.6 million on a single sixty-second commercial</span>, irate shareholders began firing off letters.</span>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The fact <span class="bold"><span class="underline">remains</span> that you can produce steel much more cheaply here than you can in Germany or the rest of the European Community.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> gamble presume presuppose pretend remain require</div>



<div class="list"> get out </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The that-clause is a new clause, with its own structure.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed</span>, where the that-clause is the Subject, but it very rarely occurs. However, there is a related passive structure beginning with introductory <span class="italics">it</span>, as in <span class="italics">It <span class="underline">was claimed</span> that she often turned up more than an hour late.</span> <r>This pattern is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9, Section 1 (see page xxx). The pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">it</span> V that</span> is also discussed in Chapter 9, Section 1 (see page xxx).</r></p>

<p>c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb.</p>

<div class="hd3">Omitting <span class="italics">that</span></div>

<p>1 After the more frequent, more basic verbs such as <span class="italics">say</span>, <span class="italics">think</span>, and <span class="italics">notice</span>, the word <span class="italics">that</span> is often left out, especially in speech.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">said</span> there was to be no talk of divorce.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">think</span> he made a tactical blunder by announcing it so far ahead of time</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, <span class="italics">that</span> tends to be used when the that-clause is separated from the Subject by a prepositional phrase, adverb group, or subordinate clause.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">A Foreign Ministry spokesman <span class="bold"><span class="underline">said</span></span> at a press briefing <span class="bold">that relations with the Community were strained</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="italics">That</span> is less often left out after more formal or less frequent words such as <span class="italics">demand</span>, <span class="italics">estimate</span>, and <span class="italics">brag</span>, and is retained when the rhythm of the sentence requires it.



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">They <span class="bold"><span class="underline">demanded</span> that he step down immediately</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The 14-year-old <span class="bold"><span class="underline">brags</span> that he has escaped from custody 31 times</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>2 In the case of meaning groups 1-5, the Subject and verb can, as with a quote clause, come within or after the that-clause, except with verbs expressing a statement or request that something should be done. The word <span class="italics">that</span> is not used.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">Things didn't,</span> he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">admitted</span>, look good in Russia</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">Italian striker Gianluca Vialli will play for Juventus next season,</span> Sampdoria president Paolo Mantovani <span class="bold"><span class="underline">confirmed</span></span> today.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>3 Some of the more frequent verbs concerned with speech, writing, and thought are also used in clauses beginning with <span class="italics">as</span>, which usually come before or within a main clause without <span class="italics">that</span>. This structure implies that, in the opinion of the user, what was said or thought is true, or turned out to be true.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">As Eamonn McCabe <span class="underline">says</span></span>, now it's up to the industry to prove him wrong.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He had, <span class="bold">as he <span class="underline">predicted</span></span>, immediately assumed an non-executive chairmanship.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>4 Some of these verbs can be used in a clause beginning with <span class="italics">as</span> or <span class="italics">than</span> when making a comparison between what people say or think about a situation and what it is really like.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I'm not as disheartened <span class="bold">as people <span class="underline">think</span></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">103</span> <span class="example">When the doorbell rang, Marianne thought it might be Jake arriving earlier <span class="bold">than he <span class="underline">had promised</span></span>.</span>

<p>5 Some verbs that have the pattern <span class="pattern">V that</span> also have the pattern <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">so</span></span> or <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">so/not</span></span>, where <span class="italics">so</span> or <span class="italics">not</span> acts as a substitute for a that-clause. <r>See pages xxx-xxx.</r></p>

<div class="hd3">Words in inverted commas</div>

<p>Sometimes some of the words in the that-clause are put in inverted commas. The inverted commas indicate that the words inside them are the actual words used, or have had only an appropriate change of tense and reference. Compare <span class="pattern">V with quote</span> (<r>pages xxx-xxx</r>).</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">On our most recent trip, our luncheon hostess commented on his attractiveness. I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">replied</span> that we were `only friends'.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">He now <span class="bold"><span class="underline">murmured</span> that `he needed a drink or he would die'</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3"><span class="italics">Should</span> or subjunctive in that-clause</div>

<p>Some verbs can have <span class="italics">should</span> or a subjunctive in the that-clause. They are concerned with statements or requests that something should be done.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The government <span class="bold"><span class="underline">has ordered</span> that people should not gather in groups of more than two on the streets</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">propose</span> that we examine two basic trends, moving in opposite directions</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">suggested</span> that we taper off the counseling sessions</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> advise advocate agree ask beg command decree demand direct insist instruct intend move ordain order plead prefer propose recommend request require rule specify stipulate suggest urge </div>

<div class="hd3">Indicating the speaker's intention</div>

<p>Verbs are usually used with the pattern <span class="pattern">V that</span> in order to describe what someone else has said or thought. However, some verbs with this pattern are often used in the simple present tense, with <span class="italics">I</span> or <span class="italics">we</span> as the Subject, as a preface to a statement, in order to indicate what kind of statement the speaker intends to make.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">I <span class="underline">confess</span> I'm sorry for her.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">I <span class="underline">insist</span> that the funds be returned.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Except in the case of verbs concerned with statements or requests that something should be done, and the verb <span class="italics">disagree</span>, the Subject and verb can come after or within the clause. The word <span class="italics">that</span> is not used.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">This, I <span class="underline">admit</span>, is still an open question.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">I'll come back for that, I <span class="underline">promise</span>.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> acknowledge admit advise agree bet concede confess confirm contend declare demand disagree guarantee insist maintain move pledge pray predict promise propose recommend submit suggest swear </div>

<span class="pg">104</span> Some verbs are used in this way with a modal: usually <span class="italics">would</span>, <span class="italics">must</span>, or <span class="italics">could</span> in a statement, and <span class="italics">may</span>, <span class="italics">can</span>, or <span class="italics">could</span> in a request.



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">I <span class="underline">must stress</span> that this is an exceedingly rare complication.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">May</span> I just <span class="bold">say</span> that we appreciated the understanding and help of all those who felt for us in our misfortune.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> add admit agree argue claim comment confess contend deny emphasize insist mention observe say state stress testify </div>

<p>Note that the verbs <span class="italics">deny</span> and <span class="italics">disagree</span> add a negative meaning to what you are saying.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">disagree</span> that it is a relatively easy matter to negotiate over hostages</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I phone twice a day but I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can't deny</span> I miss them</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd2">Other related patterns</div>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">the fact</span> that</div>

<p>Verbs concerned with feeling or thinking which do not have the pattern <span class="pattern">V that</span> can be followed by <span class="italics">the fact</span> and a that-clause, to form a structure which has a similar function to that of <span class="pattern">V that</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">But then the moment comes when they <span class="bold"><span class="underline">have to face</span> the fact that they will never, ever see their child again</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I decided to give up because I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">can</span></span> no longer <span class="bold"><span class="bold">ignore</span> the fact that it is bad for my health</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Some verbs with the pattern <span class="pattern">V that</span> can also be followed by <span class="italics">the fact that</span>, for extra emphasis.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">You <span class="bold"><span class="underline">must accept</span> the fact that you are older than you used to be</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">into</span> n that</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">into</span>, and a that-clause. The prepositional phrase indicates the person who is addressed.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'s</span></span> always <span class="bold"><span class="bold">drumming</span> into us that we must be consistent</span>.</span></li>

  <li><span class="example">But the C.O. continues to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">impress</span> on me that I am too old for this job</span>.  I think he wants to force me to relinquish my commission.</span></li>

<span class="pg">105</span> <olist cols="3"> <c sn="2">impress</c> </olist>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">to</span> n that</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span>, and a that-clause. The prepositional phrase indicates the person who is addressed, or the person to whom a fact is demonstrated. The phrasal verb pattern is <span class="pattern">V P <span class="italics">to</span> n that</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">

<p>If a verb is usually used with only one or two wh-words, this is indicated in the lists below.</p>

<div class="hd5">1 The `ask' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with speaking or writing. This includes:</p>

<ul>
 <li> asking for information e.g. <span class="italics">ask, query</span></li> <li> agreeing or discussing e.g. <span class="italics">argue, discuss</span></li> <li> giving information e.g. <span class="italics">disclose, explain</span></li>
</ul>

<p>With the verbs which are concerned with asking for information, the wh-clause indicates the question that someone wants to have answered, or might want to have answered. For example, in the clause <span class="italics">He asked who I was</span>, the wh-clause indicates a question beginning with <span class="italics">who</span>.</p>

<div class="hd5">4 The `show' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with showing that a situation exists or showing what it is like.</p>



<ul class="example">

<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Vacant land taxes enable the government to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">influence</span> where development occurs</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>The verbs <span class="italics">decide, define, determine 1,</span> and <span class="italics">dictate</span> always have an inanimate Subject. The verb <span class="italics">influence</span> sometimes has an inanimate Subject.</n>


<ul class="example">

<div class="list"> decide define determine dictate influence plan </div>

<div class="hd5">6 Verbs with other meanings</div>

<p>There are two other verbs which have this pattern.</p>

<n>The verb <span class="italics">see</span> is followed by a clause beginning with <span class="italics">if</span> or <span class="italics">what</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I'll give you a cool wash, and then we<span class="bold"><span class="underline">'ll see</span> if we can make your bed more comfortable</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">remain</span>, the wh-clause is really part of the pattern of the noun that comes before the verb.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">But the question <span class="bold"><span class="underline">remains</span> whether science is capable of ensuring that bad research is caught and bad researchers punished</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> remain see </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The wh-clause is a new clause, with its own structure.</p>

<p>Not all verbs that are sometimes followed by a clause beginning with a wh-word have the pattern <span class="pattern">V wh</span>. For example, the following sentence is not an example of a <span class="pattern">V wh</span> pattern:</p>

<span class="italics">Revson knew what it takes many people a lifetime to learn.</span>

<p>In this example, <span class="italics">what it takes many people a lifetime to learn</span> occurs in the place of an ordinary noun group.  It could be paraphrased as <span class="italics">the thing that it takes many people a lifetime to learn</span>.</p>

<p>Compare this with a sentence that does have a <span class="pattern">V wh</span> pattern:</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">knew</span> what his job was</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, <span class="italics">what his job was</span> does not occur in the place of an ordinary noun group. It indicates that something was unknown, and could be paraphrased as <span class="italics">what it was that his job was</span>.</p>

<p>b) This structure has a passive, with the pattern <span class="pattern"><span class="italics">be</span> V-ed</span>. The wh-clause is the Subject. However, the passive does not often occur, and not all verbs with this structure occur in the passive at all. The following verbs are the ones that are most frequently used in the passive.</p>

<div class="list"> decide demonstrate describe detect determine dictate discuss explain indicate reveal underline </div>

<p>c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is also a particle, P, which comes after the verb.</p>

<span class="pg">110</span> <div class="hd2">Other related patterns</div>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">of</span> n wh</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">of</span>, and a wh-clause. The prepositional phrase indicates the hearer or reader.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Kay <span class="bold"><span class="underline">inquired</span> of Seaton how things were these days over in Cremorne</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<olist cols="3"> <c sn="1">inquire</c> </olist>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">on</span> or <span class="italics">upon</span>, and a wh-clause. The prepositional phrase indicates the hearer or reader.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">impressed</span> on him what a huge honour he was being offered</span> and urged him to accept it.</span></li>
</ul>
<olist cols="3"> <c sn="2">impress</c> </olist>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">to</span> n wh</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span>, and a wh-clause. The prepositional phrase indicates the hearer or reader. The phrasal verb pattern is <span class="pattern">V P <span class="italics">to</span> n wh</span>.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">I don't like people <span class="bold"><span class="underline">dictating</span> to me what I should do and what I shouldn't do</span>.</span></li>

<p>These verbs are concerned with speaking, writing, and other forms of communication. They indicate what kind of function the speech or writing is performing. We include here <span class="italics">read 1</span> which indicates that someone understands something written.</p>










<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`Mr McClintock,'</span> she <span class="bold"><span class="underline">announced</span>, `has decided to go and visit the bank in London.'</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`What's the matter?'</span> she <span class="bold"><span class="underline">asked</span></span>, backing away a step.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`I'm sorry,'</span> Meg <span class="bold"><span class="underline">blurted out</span>. `I won't do it again, I promise.'</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`We have been told nothing,' <span class="underline">claims</span></span> Mr Matveyev.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The note had slipped down behind the teapot. She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">read</span>, `Ta for these things, but I don't need them yet. Thanks for everything.</span>'</span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`How he lost, I shall never know,' <span class="underline">remarked</span></span> Lord Howard somewhat wistfully.</span></li>

  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`How depressed I am,'</span> he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">wrote</span></span> in his diary.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>When <span class="italics">say</span> is used in conversation, the Subject and verb nearly always come before the quote clause.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Yeah 'cos somebody over there <span class="bold"><span class="underline">said</span>, erm, `Oh somebody at number a hundred and seventy-something has found a cat,</span>' and I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">said</span>, `Oh, is it white?'</span>, and he <span class="bold"><span class="bold">said</span>, `Yeah, I think so, I'm not sure,</span>' and it was all like this, and I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">was saying</span>, `Oh, it must be her, it must be her.'</span></span></li>

<div class="hd5">3 The `scream' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate how something is said, for example how loudly or quickly, or at what pitch. Some verbs, such as <span class="italics">wail</span> and <span class="italics">rasp</span>, also indicate the feeling that the speaker has (<r>see also meaning group 5 below</r>).</p>

<p>Most of these verbs are usually used in fiction rather than in journalism or conversation.</p>







<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">called out</span>, `Nina, come in here and look at this.'</span></span></li>

<div class="hd5">5 The `sneer' group</div>

<p>These verbs indicate the feeling expressed or felt by the person speaking, for example anger, enthusiasm, surprise, scorn, or unhappiness. Many of these verbs also indicate the way that something is said, to some extent.</p>

<p>Most of these verbs are usually used in fiction rather than in journalism or conversation.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`This is great!' <span class="underline">enthused</span></span> Francis.</span></li>

<span class="pg">117</span> <div class="hd5">6 The `think' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with thinking. Sometimes quotation marks are not used around the quote clause.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">What a terrible scenario,</span> I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">thought</span></span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Boisi was puzzled to see senior executives such as Cohen and Robinson darting about. <span class="bold">`Who's in charge here?'</span> he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">wondered</span></span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> muse think wonder </div>

<div class="hd5">7 The `go' group</div>

<p>These verbs are used when quoting a piece of writing or something such as a song or poem. They have an inanimate Subject.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`You can't kill the spirit, she is like a mountain,' <span class="underline">went</span></span> the Greenham women's chant.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">The sign <span class="bold"><span class="underline">read</span>: SPEED ZONE AHEAD 35 MPH</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> go read run say </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The quote clause is a new clause, with its own structure. It may be one word, such as <span class="italics">yes</span>, or it may be a long speech. The Subject and verb most frequently come after the quote clause or in the middle of it, but they sometimes come before it.</p>

<p>b) The order of Subject and verb is also variable; the Subject may come before or after the verb. Before a quote, the Subject usually comes first, although in journalism, the verb sometimes comes before the Subject: <br/><span class="italics"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Said</span></span> Mr. Fellmeth: <span class="bold">`We don't necessarily need more lawyers. We need more competent ones.'</span></span> <br/>After a quote, the Subject may come first or second, unless it is a personal pronoun. If the Subject is a personal pronoun, in modern English it always comes first.</p>

<p>c) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>d) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb.</p>

<div class="hd2">Other related patterns</div>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">after</span> n with quote</div>

<p>The verb is used with a quote clause and is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">after</span>. The Subject always comes before the verb.</p>

<p>Most verbs with this pattern indicate that someone is speaking loudly. The prepositional phrase indicates who is being addressed. The person being addressed is moving away from the speaker.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`And don't forget to send Kenny for those items!'</span> the Duchess <span class="bold"><span class="underline">called</span> after her.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<olist cols="3"> <c sn="3">call</c> <c sn="1">shout</c> <c sn="1">yell</c> </olist>

<p>The verb <span class="italics">repeat</span> indicates that someone repeats what someone else has just said. The prepositional phrase indicates the first speaker.</p>

<span class="pg">118</span> <span class="example">Then Bishop Paulk asked everyone to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">repeat</span> after him, `The Lord is God'</span> and 3,000 voices affirmed that He was.</span>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">at</span> n with quote</div>

<p>The verb is used with a quote clause and is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">at</span>. The Subject usually comes before the verb.</p>

<p>These verbs indicate that someone is speaking loudly, angrily, or forcefully. The prepositional phrase indicates who is being addressed.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`Don't panic,'</span> I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">yelled</span> at him.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">of</span> n with quote</div>

<p>The verb is used with a quote clause and is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">of</span>. The Subject usually comes before the verb. The prepositional phrase indicates who is asked a question. This pattern does not often occur.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`Who am I?'</span> I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">inquired</span> of myself</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<olist cols="3"> <c sn="1">ask</c> <c sn="1">inquire</c> </olist>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">to</span> n with quote</div>

<p>The verb is used with a quote clause and is followed by a prepositional phrase beginning with <span class="italics">to</span>. The phrasal verb pattern is <span class="pattern">V P <span class="italics">to</span> n with quote</span>. The Subject usually comes before the verb. The prepositional phrase indicates who is being addressed.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`Your cat isn't very friendly,'</span> a woman <span class="bold"><span class="underline">complained</span> to Reggie.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`This is all very well,'</span> he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">muttered</span> to himself, `but what about my dinner?'</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">said</span> to Al, `Wait a minute. What time did Steve call you?'</span></span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">muse, reason, say 4, think</span>, and <span class="italics">wonder</span>, the noun group following the preposition is always a reflexive pronoun. This pattern is <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">to</span> pron-refl with quote</span>. These verbs indicate that someone is thinking.</n> Sometimes quotation marks are not used around the quote clause.



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold">`No,'</span> he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">said</span> to himself. `It's not going to be like that.'</span></span></li>

<p>Most of the verbs in meaning group 3 can have this pattern, but it is most frequent with the ones included in the above list.</p>

<div class="hd3">V with sound</div>

<p>The verb is used with a word or group of letters representing a sound, which is not usually written in inverted commas. The Subject and verb may come before or after the sound word. If the sound word comes first, the Subject usually comes after the verb, unless it is a personal pronoun.</p>

<p>The verb indicates that a thing or an animal makes a sound.</p>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">The television <span class="bold"><span class="underline">went</span> bang</span> and then I heard an explosion in the kitchen and it was the new microwave.</span></li>

</ul>
<olist cols="3"> <c sn="3.6">go</c> </olist>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">as</span> quote</div>

<p>The verb is followed by a prepositional phrase consisting of <span class="italics">as</span> and a quote clause, which may be a single word. The quote clause indicates the meaning of a word or phrase. The Subject indicates the word or phrase concerned.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Two enterprising Neopolitan journalists are launching the game of Tangentopoli tomorrow. The name roughly <span class="bold"><span class="underline">translates</span> as `Bribe City'</span>.</span></li>

<div class="hd1">14 V <span class="italics">so/not</span></div>

<div class="st">The verb is followed by <span class="italics">so</span> or <span class="italics">not</span>.

<p>This pattern has one structure:</p>

</ul>

<span class="pg">120</span> <div class="hd4">V <span class="italics">so/not</span></div>

<p>Most of the verbs with this pattern are used to indicate what someone thinks or believes about something that has already been mentioned.  The pattern is used widely in conversation, where the Subject is often <span class="italics">I</span> or <span class="italics">you</span>.</p>

<p>We include here the verb <span class="italics">say</span>, which is used to report what someone said. It is also used to express an opinion, as in <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">would say</span> so</span>. The phrase <span class="italics">if I <span class="italics">may say</span> so</span> is used to introduce or accompany an opinion, as in <span class="italics">Utter nonsense, if I <span class="underline">may say</span> so</span>.</p>

<p>These verbs have the affirmative <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">so</span></span> and the negative <span class="pattern">V <span class="italics">not</span></span>. In the case of the verbs <span class="italics">think, believe</span>, and <span class="italics">imagine</span>, the negative is also often formed with <span class="italics">do not</span> or another auxiliary or modal, and <span class="italics">so</span>, as in <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">don't think</span> so</span>.</p>

<p>In the case of the verbs <span class="italics">assume, fear, hope, presume</span> and <span class="italics">suspect</span>, the negative is always formed with <span class="italics">not</span>, as in <span class="italics">I <span class="underline">hope</span> not</span>. You do not say <span class="italics">I don't hope so</span>.</p>





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Can anyone who eats bacon sandwiches campaign with integrity against people who eat whale meat? The Norwegians <span class="bold"><span class="underline">do not believe</span> so</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`You don't really suspect I'd be involved in something like that, do you?' `I certainly <span class="bold"><span class="underline">hope</span> not</span>, Tony.'</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">`What is he doing here on a weekday?  Is something wrong?' `From his expression I <span class="bold"><span class="underline">would say</span> so.</span></span>'</li>
  <li><span class="example">She admired him because he was clever and adroit, and because everyone whom she knew <span class="bold"><span class="underline">thought</span> so</span> too.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> assume believe fear hope imagine presume say suspect think </div>

<div class="hd5">Verbs with other meanings</div>

<p>There is one verb, <span class="italics">do</span>, which does not fit into the above meaning group. This has the affirmative <span class="italics">do so</span> only - the negative is formed with an auxiliary or modal.</p>

<span class="italics">Do so</span> can be used to stand for any verbal group. It usually refers back to another verbal group, which may be one in a previous sentence. <span class="italics">Do so</span> has an important function in repeating given information while introducing something new.  In the first example below, <span class="italics">were doing so</span> repeats the information <span class="italics">majored in education</span> while the new information in the clause is <span class="italics">in 1983 only 15 percent.</span>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">In 1963 about half of all women undergraduates majored in education. In 1983 only 15 percent <span class="bold"><span class="underline">were doing</span> so.</span></span></li>
  <li><span class="example">A stewardess said the plane was vibrating so much that she presumed the captain was going to declare an an emergency, but he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">did not do</span> so</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<span class="italics">Do so</span> occasionally refers forwards to a verbal group in the same sentence.


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">If patients wish to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">do</span> so</span>, they can buy their own needles and bring them to the acupuncturist to use for their own treatment.</span></li>

<p>Verbs with this pattern belong to the following meaning groups:</p>

<table class="mgl">
</table>

<div class="hd5">1 The `look' group</div>

<p>These verbs are used to indicate how someone or something seems. They are all <span class="bold">link verbs</span> (<r>see Chapter 5</r>). The verb <span class="italics">feel</span> indicates how someone seems to themselves. The clause after the verb indicates a situation that would make someone or something have the qualities they appear to have.</p>




<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He <span class="bold"><span class="underline">felt</span> as though he had run five miles</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">You <span class="bold"><span class="underline">look</span> like you need a rest</span>.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">Isabel's voice <span class="bold"><span class="underline">sounded</span> as if she had been crying</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> appear feel look smell sound taste </div>

<div class="hd5">2 The `act' group</div>

<p>These verbs are concerned with behaving or speaking.  The clause indicates a situation in which the behaviour or what is said would be expected or appropriate.</p>

<p>This is a productive use: any verb which indicates behaviour or action can be used with this pattern. The verbs listed here are the ones which are most frequently used in this way.</p>

<span class="pg">122</span> <span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Act</span> as if nothing had happened</span>.</span>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Some activists now <span class="bold"><span class="underline">speak</span> as though any attempt to clarify the law is a denial of justice which demands compensation</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> act behave speak talk </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information</div>

<p>a) The clause after the verb is a new clause, with its own structure.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<div class="hd2">Other related patterns</div>

<div class="hd3">V <span class="italics">as if</span> to-inf</div>

<p>The verb is followed by the conjunction <span class="italics">as if</span> and a to-infinitive clause. The clause indicates what someone seems to be about to do.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">She <span class="bold"><span class="underline">made</span> as if to leave</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<olist cols="3"> <c sn="1.3">make</c> </olist>




<a name="s16"/>
<div class="hd1">16 V <span class="italics">and</span> v</div>

<div class="st"> The verb is followed by the conjunction <span class="italics">and</span> and another verb of the same tense or form.

<p>This pattern has two structures:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Structure I: Verbs in phase<br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Try</span> and lift it.</span></li> </li>
 <li>Structure II: Co-ordinated verbs<br/><span class="italics"><span class="underline">Go</span> and find him.</span></li>

<span class="pg">123</span> The following verbs have this structure.





<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">Then he <span class="bold"><span class="underline">goes</span> and spoils</span> it all by saying that just because something shows up on the graph doesn't mean it will happen.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">They <span class="bold"><span class="underline">could go on</span> and win</span> the trophy.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">I feel that if I say how tired I get and how much I long to stay at home sometimes, David <span class="bold"><span class="underline">will turn around</span> and say</span>, `I told you so.'</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">One day he just <span class="bold"><span class="underline">upped</span> and left</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">try</span>, both verbs are always in the base form.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">He has started a privatisation programme to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">try</span> and win</span> support from the business community.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> go try up</div>



<div class="list"> go ahead go on turn around/round </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Verbs in phase</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by <span class="italics">and</span> and another verb group of the same tense or form, without a Subject or any auxiliary verbs. The verbs are <span class="bold">in phase</span>, and together form a <span class="bold">complex verb group</span>. This means that the actions or states expressed by the two verbs cannot be separated from each other. For example, if you <span class="italics">try and remember</span> something, the <span class="italics">trying</span> and the <span class="italics">remembering</span> are not two processes, but one.</p>

<p>The complex verb group is followed by a group, phrase, or clause which completes the pattern of the second verb. In the structure tables above, this is called a <span class="bold">Completive</span>. For example, if the second verb is normally followed by a noun group, then the Completive of the complex verb group will be a noun group.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb.</p>

<div class="hd3">Structure II: Co-ordinated verbs</div>

<div class="hd4">V <span class="italics">and</span> v</div>

<table border="1"><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"> &#160; </th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb group</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><span class="italics">and</span></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">clause</th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Subject</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Verb</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Co-ordinator</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Clause</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">I</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">'ll go</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">and</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">see him.</td></tr></table>

<p>This pattern is productive: any two verbs can be co-ordinated with <span class="italics">and</span>. The verbs listed here are the ones for which this pattern is most significant, that is, the two verbs are very closely linked, with the focus of information on the second verb.</p>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">Come</span> and sit down.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span class="pg">124</span> <span class="example">He was `greatly troubled' by the use of imitation weapons `because if you are on the receiving end, there isn't time to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">look</span> and see if the gun is real or not</span>'.</span>



<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">We are not going to <span class="bold"><span class="underline">stand by</span> and watch</span> when they gun our people down.</span></li>
  <li><span class="example">When you <span class="bold"><span class="underline">stop</span> and think about it</span>, the achievements of the last 20 years in the Classic Car world are stunning.</span></li>
</ul>
<n>In the case of <span class="italics">wait</span>, the conjunction <span class="italics">and</span> is nearly always followed by the base form <span class="italics">see</span>.</n>


<ul class="example">
  <li><span class="example">A spokesman said the surgeons could now only <span class="bold"><span class="underline">wait</span> and see how things went</span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="list"> come go look sit stay stop wait</div>



<div class="list"> go along go out sit by sit down sit up stand back stand by step back </div>

<div class="hd4">Structure information: Co-ordinated verbs</div>

<p>a) The verb is followed by <span class="italics">and</span> and a clause whose verb group has the same tense or form as the first verb, but has no auxiliary verbs or Subject. The verb group and the clause are co-ordinated.</p>

<p>b) This structure has no passive.</p>

<p>c) The phrasal verb pattern is the same except that there is a particle, P, which comes after the verb.</p>
